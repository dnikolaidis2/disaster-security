For this assignment a small logging library was created that overwrites the standard fopen and fwrite functions and logs them. The library that
is loaded using LD_PRELOAD environment variable creates a file in the same directory as th program tha it was called from named file_loggin.log.
To read this file a special log monitoring tool was created called acmonitor that has two modes. Show all illegal users and show which user accessed
which files and how many times the file was modified.
