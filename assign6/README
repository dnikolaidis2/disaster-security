For this assignment a packet sniffer was written in C that supports the live capturing of packets and the offline analysis
if .pcap files -i and -r options respectively. This tools was written using the pcap library for capturing packets and reading
pcap files. The rest was mostly done from scratch (structs for each packet type and ip version). Finally the live version of the
capturing utility only stops and prints the final statistics after SIGINT is sent to it through the keyboard.

"make all" to compile the program "./monitor -h" for more.
