For this assignment a small adblocking program was created using bash. This program performs a basic adblocking function
by adding iptable rules to block incoming requests from specific hostnames. Since iptables can only make rules for ip addresses the
DNS lookup utility dig was used to resolve the hostnames into addresses and then block them. To keep the rules tidy a chain was used
called adblock to hold all the rules. This is a very primitive version of adblock since most advertising services have ways to work
around blocked ip addresses, multiple domains and dynamic redirection to alternative addresses.

"sudo ./adblock -help" for more.
