For this assignment we expanded upon assignment 4 by implementing a simple ransoware program in bash that creates a number test files and encrypts
them. This ransoware also provides a decrypt function with the -d option. To be able to log the file createion the tee command line utility was used.
To also log the encryption of the files logger.so was expanded by also logging fopen64 in exactly the same way as fopen as it is the function used
by openssl. The acmonitor tool was also expanded by adding two more command line options. One for finding a large amount off file creations (-v).
Also one for detecting files that were opened to be read and then encrypted (-e).

make run command executes the ransoware with X of 50 and with the logger.so beeing preloaded.
In other cases run the ransoware as LD_PRELOAD=./logger.so ./ransoware.sh
