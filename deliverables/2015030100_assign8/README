For this assignment a small exploit was developed for the program Greeter. This program uses gets() function which is prone
to exploitation and thus a simple buffer overflow was used to exploit it. The debugger gdb was used to reverse engineer the program
with the help of its source code. Using gdb the address of buf was easily found as well as the size of the stack frame of the program.
Armed with the above knowledge a payload was designed that overrides the return address on the stack with one further down the stack. After
the overridden stack address a large(2048) nop slide was used to make sure that no matter the small changes in the stack the exploit would
have the best chance to work (ex different environment variables from one terminal to the other). After the nop slide the shellcode
aquired from http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-606.php was placed which executes
execve("/bin/bash", ["/bin/bash", "-p"], NULL) and gives us a terminal.

To run the exploit successfully we need to make sure that the terminal we launch can accept input so we call cat after outputting the exploits output.
For example:
(python3 sploit.py; cat) | ./Greeter
(cat input; cat) | ./Greeter

On gdb:
run < <(python3 /absolute/path/to/sploit.py; cat)
run < <(cat input; cat)

ASLR needed to be disabled with “echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space” to get this exploit to work.
