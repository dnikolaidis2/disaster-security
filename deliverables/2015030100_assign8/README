For this assignment a small exploit was developed for the program Greeter. This program uses gets() function which is prone
to exploitation and thus a simple buffer overflow was used to exploit it. The debugger gdb was used to reverse engineer the program
with the help of its source code. Using gdb the address of Name was easily found as well as the size of the stack frame of the function readString.
The program reads into buf with gets and then copies 128 bytes from buf to Name which has all memory protections turned off. Armed with this knowledge
a payload was designed that overrides the return address on the stack with the address of Name + padding length + address length. After the padding
and address the shellcode to be executed was placed into the buffer. This shellcode was aquired from http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-606.php 
and it only runs execve("/bin/bash", ["/bin/bash", "-p"], NULL) and gives us a terminal.

To run the exploit successfully we need to make sure that the terminal we launch can accept input so we call cat after outputting the exploits output.
For example:
(python3 sploint.py; cat) | ./Greeter
(cat input; cat) | ./Greeter

On gdb:
run < <(python3 /absolute/path/to/sploit.py; cat)
run < <(cat input; cat)
