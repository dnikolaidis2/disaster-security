For this assignment a packet sniffer was written in C that supports the live capturing of packets and the offline analysis
if .pcap files -i and -r options respectively. This tools was written using the pcap library for capturing packets and reading
pcap files. The rest was mostly done from scratch (structs for each packet type and ip version). Finally the live version of the
capturing utility only stops and prints the final statistics after SIGINT is sent to it through the keyboard. Retransmissions
were detected for TCP packets based on the sequence number and the expected sequence number which was calculated for every flow.
For UDP packets since it's a connectionless protocol there is no way to detect retransmissions.

"make all" to compile the program "./monitor -h" for more.
